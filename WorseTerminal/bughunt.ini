[Level 1]
language = python
code = 
    def add(a, b):
    <tab>return a - b
hint = Check the operator used in the return statement.
answerkeywords = addition, add, plus, sum, mistake, operator, incorrect, invert, subtract, subtracting, subtraction, adding, opposite
explanation = The function is supposed to add two numbers, but it's subtracting them instead. Just change the minus sign to a plus.

[Level 2]
language = python
code = 
    for i in range(5)
    <tab>print(i)
hint = Missing something important after the for loop declaration.
answerkeywords = syntax error, colon, :, missing, expected, indentation
explanation = You forgot the colon at the end of the for loop line. It's required to tell Python where the loop starts.

[Level 3]
language = javascript
code = 
    function greet(name) {
    <tab>console.log("Hello, " + Name);
    }
hint = Variable names are case-sensitive.
answerkeywords = case, sensitive, Name, name, variable, identifier, typo, casing
explanation = JavaScript cares about uppercase and lowercase letters. You wrote "Name" with a capital N instead of "name".

[Level 4]
language = python
code = 
    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    print(mylist[0])
hint = Check how the list variable is referenced.
answerkeywords = NameError, typo, my_list, mylist, reference, undefined, variable, underscore, missing
explanation = You named the list "my_list" but then tried to use "mylist" without the underscore. Python thinks it's a new, undefined variable.

[Level 5]
language = java
code =
    public class Main {
    <tab>public static void main(String[] args) {
    <tab><tab>System.out.println("Hello world);
    <tab>}
    }
hint = String literals need proper ending.
answerkeywords = syntax, missing quote, quotes, string, delimiter, unclosed
explanation = The string is missing the closing quote. Java needs both quotes to know where the text ends.

[Level 6]
language = python
code = 
    def factorial(n):
    <tab>if n == 0:
    <tab><tab>return 0
    <tab>else:
    <tab><tab>return n * factorial(n-1)
hint = What is factorial(0) supposed to return?
answerkeywords = base case, return, 1, factorial(0), math, recursion, wrong, output, incorrect, one, zero
explanation = By math, the factorial of zero is 1. Returning 0 breaks the calculation, so change it to 1.

[Level 7]
language = c
code = 
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main() {
    <tab>int a = 5;
    <tab>if (a = 10) {
    <tab><tab>printf("a is 10\n");
    <tab>}
    <tab>return 0;
    }
hint = Assignment inside if-condition?
answerkeywords = assignment, ==, wrong, operator, condition, bug, logical error
explanation = The single equals sign assigns 10 to "a" instead of comparing. Use "==" to check if "a" equals 10.

[Level 8]
language = python
code = 
    my_dict = {'a':1, 'b':2}
    print(my_dict['c'])
hint = What happens if you ask for a key that's not there?
answerkeywords = KeyError, exception
